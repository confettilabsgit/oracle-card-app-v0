Subject: Introducing The Persian Oracle & Fal-e-Hafez ✨

Hi [Friend's Name],

I wanted to share something special with you that my family has been working on. We've created two beautiful digital experiences inspired by Persian mysticism and the poetry of Hafez.

**The Persian Oracle** - A card-based reading where you flip three mystical cards to receive wisdom from Hafez, with both brief insights and deeper interpretations. It's like having a conversation with ancient Persian wisdom.

**Fal-e-Hafez** - A more intimate experience where you can enter a question or intention, then "open" a digital book to discover a personalized verse from Hafez with interpretations tailored to what's on your mind.

Both experiences are bilingual (English and Persian), beautifully designed, and completely free. They're perfect for moments when you need a bit of reflection, guidance, or just want to connect with something deeper.

I'd love for you to try them out and let me know what you think. You can find them at [your website URL].

Hope you're doing well!

[Your Name]
